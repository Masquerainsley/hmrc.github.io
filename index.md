## Welcome

Welcome to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on [GitHub](https://github.com/hmrc). Here you can learn about the HMRC Multichannel Digital Tax Platform (MDTP), the citizen and company digital tax services hosted on the MDTP, and the Agile principles and practices that underpin our delivery of the MDTP.

## The Multichannel Digital Tax Platform (MDTP)

The Multichannel Digital Tax Platform (MDTP) gives access to digital tax products that allow British citizens and companies to manage their tax affairs. The MDTP is a [Platform As A Service (PaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) that hosts 100+ [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)/[Play](https://www.playframework.com/) microservices that represent 20+ citizen and company tax products.

## Coding In The Open

HMRC has a firm commitment to **Coding In The Open** - developing, testing, building, and releasing code in such a way that the British taxpayer can observe and contribute to progress.

The digital services hosted on the MDTP are developed according to the [Government Digital Service (GDS)](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/about/) [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and [Digital Service Standards](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default). In the GDS Digital Service Standards, Point 8 says:

> "Make all new source code open and reusable, and publish it under appropriate licences (or provide a convincing explanation as to why this cannot be done for specific subsets of the source code)"

At HMRC, we are making all new source code open and reusable at [HMRC on GitHub](https://www.github.com/hmrc) and publishing it under the [Apache 2 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). We are also providing a view of our continuous build system at [HMRC on Travis](https://travis-ci.org/hmrc/), and publishing our artifacts at [HMRC on Bintray](https://www.bintray.com/hmrc)

Business-critical or security-critical configuration and/or code may remain within internal HMRC systems, but the vast majority of MDTP digital services are either open-sourced or in the process of being open-sourced. More information will be announced soon.

At HMRC, we want to be transparent about what we are spending money on. Our manifesto is:

> "The MDTP has been paid for by the UK public so they should have it available to them if they want"

Hopefully the repositories that we produce are of use to other Open Source projects, but at worst they will provide real world examples of using the [Play Framework](https://playframework.com/), interacting with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) using [ReactiveMongo](http://reactivemongo.org/), etc.

Of course if you think there is a better way of doing something then submit a pull request or raise an issue - but don't send a letter, we are [Digital By Default](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/start) after all!
