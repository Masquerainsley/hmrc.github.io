### Welcome

Welcome to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on GitHub. Here you can learn about the HMRC Multichannel Digital Tax Platform (MDTP), the citizen and company tax products hosted on the MDTP, and the Agile principles and practices that underpin MDTP delivery.

### The Multichannel Digital Tax Platform (MDTP)

The Multichannel Digital Tax Platform (MDTP) is a place for British citizens and companies to come and manage their tax affairs. The MDTP is a [Platform As A Service (PaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) that hosts 100+ microservices that represent 20+ citizen and company tax products.

### Coding In The Open

HMRC has a firm commitment to Coding In The Open - developing, testing, building, and releasing code in such a way that the British taxpayer can contribute.

The vast majority of HMRC tax products are either open-sourced on GitHub or in the process of being open-sourced at present. More information will be announced soon.
