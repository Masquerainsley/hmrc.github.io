Welcome to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on GitHub. Here you can learn about the HMRC Multichannel Digital Tax Platform (MDTP), the citizen and company tax products hosted on the MDTP, and the Agile principles and practices that underpin MDTP delivery.

HMRC has a firm commitment to Coding In The Open, and the vast majority of HMRC tax products are either open-sourced on GitHub or in the process of being open-sourced.
